## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I've recently learned about, and implemented solutions (_in the workplace_) using [NATS](https://nats.io/) (including server administration), [OpenFMB](https://openfmb.openenergysolutions.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). I've instrumented multiple services using the Golang client, but I'd never administered the Prometheus server before (until Q2 2023).
- I really do love `Golang`. It hits a sweet spot with simplicity and productivity in return for some reduced expressivity. Over the last 3+ years using it consistently, I've created and maintained at least a dozen microservices (and a few monoliths). Its increasing popularity and continued improvements are exciting to witness and participate in! I also find the notion of the [V language](https://vlang.io/) very tantalizing!
- I have had the pleasure of using [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), _consistently_ in the last several years. **(Including at my current job)**
- Over the years, I've become a consistent student and seeker of improved understanding, mental models, and proficiency with, `system design`, `clean architecture`, `design patterns`, as well as `functional programming paradigms` (such as `parametric polymorphism` and `algebraic structures`!). I am continuing to enjoy finding the correct balance with [TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) for each project I encounter.
- I love learning about DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering). I cannot wait for the opportunity to use these domain modeling skills enthusiastically with a team.
- This has recently shot to the top of my interests and pursuits: I really want to maintain and improve my mathematical fluency/literacy and my knowledge/skills around `formal methods and modeling in software engineering` (i.e. **primarily** [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html), and [Alloy 6+](https://alloytools.org)), tools that can help with `validation` and `verification` (i.e. [CUE](https://cuelang.org/)), `reproducibility` especially as this applies to distributed systems, `telemetry` and `observability`: the sought-after trinity of `Metrics`, `Logs`, and `Tracing`! ([this talk](https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/cncf-on-demand-webinar-understand-your-system-like-never-before/) blew my mind, and so did [this clojure talk](https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s), as well as [this formal methods talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YjsSDDWFDY), and there are other [fascinating talks/links](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/) to be explored)!
- Creating readable, testable, verifiably correct, and scalable microservices is the zone I have lived in for the past several years. There is always an ongoing pursuit of writing _great_ code and improving my skills around System Administration, and DevOps (most concretely, improving adeptness with `CI/CD` tools).
- I  have also used [Nix](https://nixos.org/), [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), and [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) in the last few years, but I've grown a little bit rusty with time. I really enjoyed working with these tools and I'm seeking to refresh myself and derive new insights with these tools ASAP!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really just about any FOSS, but probably focused on projects using [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), or [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) **(especially _Golang_ as that has been my primary language of choice/use for the last 3+ years!)**
- I am endlessly curious and fascinated by programming languages. I definitely want to continue improving my skills with `Rust`, but I'm looking for any excuse to study, learn, and use [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/index), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), and/or even an Array-oriented language like [APL](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm)!
- Improving the developer experience for myself and those around me is yet another top-tier priority to me. I would _love_ to participate in a developer book club or something like that!

### Community Involvement

I'm an _avid_ believer in FOSS, and contributing as much as I can with open source code, documentation, etc. But I sponsor multiple projects, foundations, and developers.
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [github](https://github.com/andrew-werdna?tab=sponsoring)
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [open collective](https://opencollective.com/altair-cepheus)
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user/creators?u=19921043)
  - I also donate to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/andrew101werdna) because I want online learning to be as accessible and available as possible
  - I'm also a proud member of
    - the [Linux Foundation](https://openprofile.dev/profile/ab7100)
    - the [IEEE](https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/app/p/AndrewBrown1006690)
  - I'm a proud supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/)
