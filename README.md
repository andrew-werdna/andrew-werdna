### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about [gRPC](https://grpc.io), [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/), [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [nix](https://nixos.org/), [graphql](https://graphql.org/), & [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really just about any FOSS, but probably focused on projects using [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- I am looking for an excuse to start using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) or [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- I've become very interesting in system design, clean architecture, design patterns, as well as functional programming paradigms
- I also really want to improve my mathematical fluency/literacy and my knowledge/skills around formal verification, reproducibility especially as this applies to distributed systems, microservices, DevOps, _and_ writing clean, readable, adaptable code.
