## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I've recently learned about, and implemented solutions using [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), [nix](https://nixos.org/), [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really just about any FOSS, but probably focused on projects using [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), or [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix)
- I have finally started building real proficiency with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) in some real projects
- I'm looking for any excuse to continue learning and becoming more proficient with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/index), and [Zig](https://ziglang.org)
- I've become very interesting in, and am avidly pursuing improved understanding, mental models, familiarity, and proficiency with, `system design`, `clean architecture`, `design patterns`, as well as `functional programming paradigms` (such as `parametric polymorphism` and `algebraic structures`!). I am continuing to practice, study, and improve with [TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). I have accrued quite a video list and book list on these topics and am enjoying reading and soaking them in!
- This has recently shot to the top of my interests and pursuits. I really want to maintain and improve my mathematical fluency/literacy and my knowledge/skills around `formal methods and modeling in software engineering` (i.e. [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html), [Alloy](https://alloytools.org), and [P framework](https://p-org.github.io/P/)), tools that can help with `validation` and `verification` (i.e. [CUE](https://cuelang.org/)), `reproducibility` especially as this applies to distributed systems, `telemetry` and `observability` ([this talk](https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/cncf-on-demand-webinar-understand-your-system-like-never-before/) blew my mind, and so did [this clojure talk](https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s), as well as [this formal methods talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YjsSDDWFDY), and there are other [fascinating talks/links](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/) to be explored), microservices, DevOps, _and_ writing clean, readable, adaptable code.
- Improving the developer experience for myself and those around me is yet another high priority to me, and something I'm fascinated by.

### Community Involvement

I'm an _avid_ believer in FOSS, and contributing as much as I can with open source code, documentation, etc. But I sponsor multiple projects, foundations, and developers.
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [github](https://github.com/andrew-werdna?tab=sponsoring)
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [open collective](https://opencollective.com/altair-cepheus)
  - See who I'm sponsoring via [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user/creators?u=19921043)
  - I also donate to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/andrew101werdna) because I want online learning to be as accessible and available as possible
  - I'm also a proud member of
    - the [linux foundation](https://openprofile.dev/profile/ab7100)
    - the [IEEE](ieee.org)
  - I'm a proud supporter of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/)
