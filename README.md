### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about [gRPC](https://grpc.io), [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/), & [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really just about any FOSS, but probably focused on projects using [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- I really am hoping I have the chance to start using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
