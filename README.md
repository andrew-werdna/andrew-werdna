### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about, and implementing solutions using [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [gRPC](https://grpc.io), [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/), [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [nix](https://nixos.org/), [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [graphql](https://graphql.org/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really just about any FOSS, but probably focused on projects using [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- I am looking for an excuse to start using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), or [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- I've become very interesting in, and am avidly pursuing improved understanding, mental models, familiarity, and proficiency with, `system design`, `clean architecture`, `design patterns`, as well as `functional programming paradigms` (such as `parametric polymorphism` and `algebraic structures`!). I am continuing to practice, study, and improve with [TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). I have accrued quite a video list and book list on these topics and am enjoying reading and soaking them in!
- This has recently shot to the top of my interests and pursuits. I really want to maintain and improve my mathematical fluency/literacy and my knowledge/skills around `formal verification` (i.e. [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html), and [Alloy](https://alloytools.org)), tools that can help with `validation` and `verification` (i.e. [CUE](https://cuelang.org/)), `reproducibility` especially as this applies to distributed systems, `telemetry` and `observability` ([this talk](https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/cncf-on-demand-webinar-understand-your-system-like-never-before/) blew my mind, and there are other [fascinating talks/links](https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/) to be explored), microservices, DevOps, _and_ writing clean, readable, adaptable code.
